I do encourage all of you here na: 

1. magstart gumawa ng LinkedIn.
2. Setup profile, best photo that looks professional (mas malinaw mas maganda)
- Add skills/tools that you use in the description.
So that you are going to appear frequently in the searches.
3. Share small wins(projects or mini projects that you are working with) kahit progress sa project, pwedeng screenshot.
-So that you can have social media presence. At makita rin ng recruiter yung mga gawa mo.
4. Connect with other developers.
-commend other dev works, react posts and share interesting posts.
5. Accept connections from recruiters. Always reply na "thank you for connecting etc."

If applying stage na ikaw, create a resume/CV. 
Merong easy apply feature si Linkedin, click lang sa jobs tapos filter search(easy apply). Few clicks lang kaya marami ka maaapplyan in short period of time.

Baon ng mahabang pasesnya, kase halos 1month na ako actively applying pero halos walang pumapansin madalas rejection, lately lang sabay sabay interview, kaw na lang maloloka. Be confident! 

For interview tips, just always show your enthusiasm or sa tagalog, ligalig hahaha. Like hype na hype ka maging part ng tean. And opkors always smileeeee üòÅ
